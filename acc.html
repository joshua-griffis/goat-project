      <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> has accumulated many awards and was overall a very accomplished physicist. In 1921, Albert even received a nobel peace prize in Physics. Albert Einstein has also often been called “father of the atomic bomb” and blamed for its creation, but historically this is not true and this fact should be set straight. The only push in that direction was a letter to then president Franklin D. Roosevelt in which he encouraged the US to seek to build the atomic bomb before the German’s did. He only did this because he thought they were at a point where they would succeed at it. He later stated that if he knew they would not succeed, he would have said nothing to the President. Anyway, we all know the havoc and ruin caused by the atom bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the WWII. Apart from this great, yet dangerous invention, there are many accomplishments of Albert Einstein. His major accomplishments have given present day scientists enough information about our universe to assist us in getting men into space and knowing more about the earth and our immediate sun as well as the stars millions of miles away.</p>
