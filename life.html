      <p><strong>Albert Einstein`s</strong> early life was not short of his brilliance. He was born on the 14th of March in 1879 in Ulm of the German Empire to Jewish parents. At just age twelve, he had discovered his own proof of the Pythagorean theorem, foreshadowing his great mathematical genius. At the age of fifteen, he dropped out of high school because of his distaste for the archaic and industrial disciplinary teaching methods that would limit the freedom of students' learning capabilities. Einstein believed that traditional high school education success was based on memorization and obedience rather than creative freedom. He went on to study at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich where he would graduate in 1900. Not being able to find his footing at first right after graduating, he felt that it might’ve been a mistake to become a physicist. As it states, “As a somewhat precocious young man, I was struck by the futility of the hopes and the endeavors that most men chase restlessly throughout life. And I soon realized the cruelty of that chase, which in those days was more carefully disguised with hypocrisy and glittering words than it is today” (history.org). It wasn’t until he got an offer at a position at the Swiss Patent Office at Bern as an assistant examiner. This position allowed him to secure an income and satisfied his pursuit of physics. It was at this part of his career that he started making and formulating his revolutionary theorems.</p>
